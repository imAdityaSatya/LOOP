>  Swipe-able from left to right and vice-versa 

>  Just like images in your phone gallery

>  A collage of images capturing memorable moments of the birthday person
                          

LOOP 2.0 (the video scroller)  

>  Swipe-able from top to bottom and vice-versa

>  Just like the Instagram reels or YouTube shorts

>  A collage of videos capturing memorable moments of the birthday person

You can use either of these Android apps to digitally wish your loved ones a very happy birthday. 

But please note that the APK files provided here are just the sample ones, which you can download to explore and get a basic idea of the look and feel of the apps. 

To fully utilize these apps, you will need to customize them by adding your preferred media files (images or videos). 

If you have basic Android skills, you can go ahead with the customization on your own. 

Otherwise, please feel free to contact me and I will help customize the app as per your needs.
